# Customer and sales Analysis

## Project overview

This project focuses on analyzing a transactional retail sales dataset using SQL. The database simulates sales across various product categories, along with customer demographics and purchase details. The goal of the project is to extract meaningful insights using SQL to support business and marketing decisions.


## Database Structure

The project uses a single table containing transactional data with the following fields:

| Column Name       | Description                              |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `transactions_id` | Unique identifier for each sale          |
| `sale_date`       | Date of the transaction                  |
| `sale_time`       | Time when the sale occurred              |
| `customer_id`     | Unique ID of the customer                |
| `gender`          | Gender of the customer                   |
| `age`             | Age of the customer                      |
| `category`        | Product category of the purchase         |
| `quantiy`         | Quantity of products bought              |
| `price_per_unit`  | Unit price of the product                |
| `cogs`            | Cost of goods sold                       |
| `total_sale`      | Total amount of the transaction          |
